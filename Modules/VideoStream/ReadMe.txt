the VideoStream project is for pure video stream in the logic game server. The video is generated by the logic server instead of the render proxy. That is to say, the VideoStream will not migrate the rendering to a RenderProxy, render the game locally and generate the video.

The project will generate a DLL, it can hook D3D or just capture Window.
